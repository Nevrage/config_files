Evening Delia,

I have received the motherboard unfortunately I have not been able to
try it.

Unlike the unit I sent it came with one of your proprietary CPU cooler
bracket that is not compatible with the Intel stock one.

To not have to do the back and forth with the motherboard any chance you
can send me anything compatible with it?

Thanks,
